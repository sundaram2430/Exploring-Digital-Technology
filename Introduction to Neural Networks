📌 What is a Neural Network?
*A neural network is basically a type of computer program whoch is inspired by the brain of human beings.
*Neural networks are made up of artificials neurons that process and transmit information.
*Thy are used in wide range of applications such as : - 🖼️ Image recognition  
                                                     - 🎤 Speech processing  
                                                     - 🌍 Language translation  
                                                     - 🎮 Game playing
📌Why to use Neural Networks?
- 📚 Learn from data
- 🧩 Recognize complex patterns
- 🔁 Improve performance over time
- 🔍 Handle large and high-dimensional data

📌Basic Structure
*A neural  network is made up of varies layrs of nodes which also called neurons:
i)  Input Layer : This layer receives the raw data. Such as: Image pixels, Numbers
ii) Hidden Layers : This is th layer where actual processing take place through mathematical functions. Which consist of neurons connected by weights.
iii)Output Layer : This layer produces the final prediction or results.
