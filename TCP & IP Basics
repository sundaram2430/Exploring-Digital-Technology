TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol where as IP stands for Internet Protocol.
TCP & IP are the fundamental suite of communication protocols for the internet also the backbone of th internet.
TCP ensures rliable transmission such as phone call, etc... where as IP handles addressingeand routing- like 
writing a postal address on a package.
TCP/IP basically breaks data into packets then send them across networks and resembles them.
In comparision between TCP/IP and OSI, TCP/IP uses 4 layers where as OSI uses 7 layers, but they serv similar functions.


There are four layers of TC/IP Model:
(I)  Network Interface: It Handles physical transmission of data. 
                        Also responsible for devic-to-device communication in same network.
                        Such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi ...
(ii) Internet Layer: It Routes packets across networks.
                     Also provides logocal addrssing.
                     Key protocols such as IP, ICMP ...
(iii) Transport Layer: It Manages end-to-end communication.
                       Two main protocols are TCP and UDP (User Datagram Protocol)...
(iv)  Application Layer: It Supports network services & apps.
                         It acts as a interferaces with user applications.
                         Protocols such as HTTP, FTP, DNS, SMTP...


IP Addresses & Routing:
Every device has an IP address (such as: 192.167.1.1).
Routers move data between networks using these IP addresses.
Public IPs are routable across the internet.

Common TCP/IP Protocols
(i)  HTTP/HTTPS – web browsing
(ii) FTP/SFTP – file transfers
(iii)SMTP/IMAP – email
(iv) DNS – domain name resolution
