Binary numbers are fundamental i computing and digital systems. Computer System work only on these binary digits.
Following are the steps to to convert positive Decimal number to Binary:
i)   Divide the number by 2
ii)  Record the remainder.
iii) Repeat the process with the quoitent until it becomes 0.
iv)  Write tthe reaminders in reverse order to get the binary number of that particular decimal number.

Example: Convert 33 to Binary
i)  33 ÷ 2 = 16, remainder 1
ii) 16 ÷ 2 = 8, remainder 0
iii) 8 ÷ 2 = 4, remainder 0
iv)  4 ÷ 2 = 2, remainder 0
v)   2 ÷ 2 = 1, remainder 0
vi)  1 ÷ 2 = 0, remainder 1

Therefore, the binary of 33 is 100001.

Following are the steps to check either the conversion from decimal to binary is correct or not:
i)  (1 × 2⁵) = 32
ii) (0 × 2⁴) = 0
iii)(0 × 2³) = 0
iv) (0 × 2²) = 0
v)  (0 × 2¹) = 0
vi) (1 × 2⁰) = 1
Adding up: 32 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 33
Thus, 100001 in decimal is 33.

Two's Complement (8-bit): Negative values are represented in binary by using two's complement. This method simplifies arithimatic operations.

Steps to find 2's complement:
i)   Write the positive binary equivalent (using a fixed bit-length, e.g., 8 bits).
ii)  Invert all bits (0s to 1s and 1s to 0s).
iii) Add 1 to the inverted binary number.

Example: convert -35 to two's complement (8-bit)
Step1: 33 in binary (8-bit): 00100001
Step2: Invert the bits: 11011110
Step3: Add 1: 11011111
Therefore, -33 in two’s complement (8-bit) is 11011111.
